## EventHive - Event Booking API 🎟️
EventHive is the backend API for a simple event booking app.

Think of it as the "engine" that runs everything behind the scenes. This project wasn't just hacked together; I built it properly using the ```Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)```. That just means I did the planning and design work before jumping into the code, and then followed up with proper testing.

A key feature here is ```Role-Based Access Control```, which is a fancy way of saying the API knows the difference between a regular ```USER``` and an ```ADMIN``` and gives them different powers.
